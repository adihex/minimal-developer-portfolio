          I am currently a final year student of Bachelor of Technology in
          Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology
          Bhubaneswar. I have completed my internship at Publicis Sapient from
          May-June 2023. I have always been passionate about computers and this
          led me to choose CSE as my branch and Software Engineering as my
          career profession.
