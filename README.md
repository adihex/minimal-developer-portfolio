# My personal developer portfolio

This project contains the source code for my personal portfolio website hosted at [Portfolio](https://adihex.github.io/minimal-developer-portfolio/). This project has been created using React.js and Vite. Tailwind CSS has been used for the styling.

Thanks to Forrester Knight for his amazing video on this topic!
